## 📖 About

**Dawn** is a design-focused fork of Novery, keeping its novel sources, reader engine, TTS, offline reading, and recommendation features while introducing a new visual system for reading web novels from multiple sources. The redesign is built on the existing project and remains under GPL-3.0. Inspired by [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi) and [QuickNovel](https://github.com/LagradOst/QuickNovel), it provides a clean, customizable reading experience with **Text-to-Speech**, **offline reading**, and **personalized recommendations** — all built with **Jetpack Compose** and **Material 3**.
